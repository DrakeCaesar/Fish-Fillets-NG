Game:
- animation
- dialogs
- game menu
- load and save
- player statistics
- intro
- better controls
- fish heads animation when they are pushing something
...

- How are heads 'mrk', 'sklebi', 'shocking' used in zrc.rum room?


Engine:
- NOTE: SDL_RLEACCEL may speedup transparent bliting
- NOTE: SDL_WarpMouse() may be enough instead moving window

- make nice aap build

- define SYSTEM_DATA_DIR and USER_DATA_DIR in build

- make the engine independent on Name, app developer should not
  need to edit Name.h
